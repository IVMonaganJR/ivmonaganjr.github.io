## About Me

I'm a third-year collaborative Ph.D. student with Columbia University and the American Museum of Natural History, where I am co-advised by Shahid Naeem and Christopher Raxworthy. I study the mechanisms of population extinction, and the eco-evolutionary processes driving squamate community structure in insular systems and anthropogenic landscapes in Madagascar. My research integrates phylogeographic, population genetic, and functional trait data to uncover historical and contemporary processes that shape species diversity.
